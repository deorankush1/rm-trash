It's better to make an alias for rm\-trash. For example :
.PP
alias trash="rm\-trash"
.PP
or
.PP
alias del="rm\-trash"
.PP
Save the above alias in a file '.bash_aliases' in '/home/natesh/.bash_aliases' (create the file if not present).
.PP
By default, rm\-trash does not remove directories.
Use the \fB\-\-recursive\fR (\fB\-r\fR or \fB\-R\fR)
.PP
option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.
.PP
To remove a file whose name starts with a '\-', for example '\-foo',
use one of these commands:
rm\-trash \fB\-\-\fR \fB\-foo\fR
.PP
rm\-trash ./\-foo
.PP
Note that if you use rm\-trash to remove a file it can be recovered from trash.
If you want to make files unrecoverable, consider using shred.
