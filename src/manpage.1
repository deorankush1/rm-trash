By default, rm\-trash does not remove directories.  Use the \fB\-\-recursive\fR (\fB\-r\fR or \fB\-R\fR)
option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.
.PP
To remove a file whose name starts with a '\-', for example '\-foo',
use one of these commands:
.IP
rm\-trash \fB\-\-\fR \fB\-foo\fR
.IP
rm\-trash ./\-foo
.PP
Note that if you use rm\-trash to remove a file it can be recovered from trash.
For greater assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.
